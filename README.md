# MUON-PARTICLE-SIMULATION-DETECTION-and-RECONSTRUCTION
In this repository we have given codes for Cherenkov Light simulation, its track reconstruction using GNN and MLP and identification using Hough Transformation.
The codes in this repository are from my 3 projects/ research work, viz., Simulation Design for a prototype Water Cherenkov Neutrino Telescope,  Track Reconstruction using GNN for Neutrino Telescope,  Track Identification using Hough Transform for VLNT.
